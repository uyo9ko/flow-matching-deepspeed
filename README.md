# Flow-Matching with DeepSpeed  
A streamlined implementation of a flow-matching image generation task, powered by **Accelerate**.

## Overview  
This project adapts and simplifies code from the [Rectified Flow (PyTorch)](https://github.com/lucidrains/rectified-flow-pytorch) repository, bringing a lightweight and efficient setup for image generation using DeepSpeed.

## Features  
- Minimal setup for flow-matching-based image generation.  
- Efficient acceleration with **Accelerate** and **DeepSpeed**.  
- Simplified code structure for ease of customization and understanding.
